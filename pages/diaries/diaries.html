            This week in our apartment was a whirlwind of activity andnew experiences.On Monday, Lisa seemed stressed abouta big project, so l did my best to offer comfort, nestlingclose to her while she worked at her desk. It's a tough job.but someone's got to do it! Midweek, the weather turnedaloomy. and we spent Wednesday listening to the rairpatter against the windows.I found a cozy spot on the win-dowsill and watched the city transform under a veil of rain,feeling content in our warm, dry haven. On Thursday. Lisawas on a video call for hours for her work. Seizing the opoortunity.l paraded back and forth in front of the camerabasking in the attention from the faces on the screen. I'mpretty sure I was the star of the show.

            This week was particularly exciting. Lisa's roommate's momcame over and was cooking something that smelled heav-enly. I tried my best to snatch a taste, but alas, I was caughtin the act and shooed away - but not before  aot a smalllick. lt was delicious! The weekend was a blissful blur. Lisatook a break from her studies, and we had an extendeoplay session with a new toy she bought.I've never seenanything like it, and I pounced and leaped until l was tootired to move. At night. I curled up next to her on the coucrpurring as she stroked my fur, the glow of the city lightscasting a warm hue over us. Life in this busy city is alwaysan adventure, but I wouldn't have it any other way.        </div>

            This week started off with the usual buzz of New York City, but fromthe cozy viewpoint of my sunny windowsill in our apartment. Lisa wabustling around with colorful papers and pencils totally absorbed irher work.I took advantage of her distraction to sneak into her back-pack and play with the fascinating trinkets i found there. Tuesday wa'quieter. Lisa was glued to her computer, so I curled up on her lappurring contentedly and occasionally pawing at the screen. It's agame we play; she pretends to be annoyed, but l know she loves it.

            This week was filled with new sights and sounds from our little corner inNew York City. Lisa was juggling multiple projects, which meant morepaper and pencils for me to scatter around the apartment. On Monday, ldiscovered the joy of batting at her pencil every time it rolled off the tableShe wasn't too thrilled. but i found it incredibly amusing. Tuesday broughan unexpected adventure. Lisa left a window slightly ajar, and l sat therefor hours, watching the bustling streets below, mesmerized by the city'ssymphony of honks and chatter. On Wednesday, l had a lazy day. Whilemy human sketched and muttered about deadlines,  lounged in the sunbeam on our carpet, basking in the warmth.        </div>
